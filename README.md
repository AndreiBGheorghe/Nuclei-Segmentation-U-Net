# Nuclei-Segmentation-U-Net

In this project, I implement the U-Net neural network architecture within an application designed to detect and segment cell nuclei in microscopic images. The U-Net model is well-suited for image segmentation tasks due to its encoder-decoder structure, allowing precise localization of nuclei boundaries in complex cellular images.

This project uses datasets from the Kaggle platform for nuclei segmentation in microscopic cell images. The main data sources used are:

More information about this project can be found in the Project Documentation PDF.
