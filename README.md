# Nuclei-Segmentation-U-Net

In this project, I implement the U-Net neural network architecture within an application designed to detect and segment cell nuclei in microscopic images. The U-Net model is well-suited for image segmentation tasks due to its encoder-decoder structure, allowing precise localization of nuclei boundaries in complex cellular images.

More information about this project can be found in the Project Documentation PDF.
